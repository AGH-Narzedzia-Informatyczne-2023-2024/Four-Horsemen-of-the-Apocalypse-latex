\section{Mateusz Battek}

I added a photo of a khachapuri (see Figure~\ref{fig:hadzapuri}).

\begin{figure}[h] % Co oznacza [htbp]?
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pictures/hadzapuri.jpg}
    \caption{This khachapuri is not real.}
    \label{fig:hadzapuri}
\end{figure}

Here is also a worth seeing equation: \[P=\pi r^2\]

It helps calculating the surface area of khachapuri.\\
Another one is here:
$ x^n + y^n = z^n $

This one is completely random.

\newpage

Table~\ref{tab:dish_prices} represents prices of different dishes.

\input{tables/tabela_mb}

List of good dishes:
\begin{itemize}[label=$\spadesuit$]
  \item Khachapuri
  \item Pizza
  \item Pierogi
\end{itemize}

Good dishes ranked:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Khachapuri (the real one)
  \item Pizza (the good one)
  \item Pierogi (with meat ones)
\end{enumerate}

Best dishes are made of this, who am i to disagree.
I travel the world and the seven seas, everybody's looking for something.

I am writing random stuff just to make this paragraph look long,
I could use lorem ipsum, but that would be too easy. Now this is the end.

\underline{Yesterday} all my troubles seemed so far away,
now it looks as tough they're here to stay.
Now I wish I had a place to hide away,
I believe in \underline{yesterday}
Remember that the best dish is khachapuri shown in the figure \ref{fig:hadzapuri}.
Yesterday is the key to understand your past and that it's not important.
The only thing you should care about is present. So focus and be yourself
or \textbf{\emph{lose yourself}}. You can see prices of good dishes in table \ref{tab:dish_prices}
